MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY WILSON Attached is our February report on the ICBM and IRBM programs. The summary is suggested for transmittal to the President. Unless a decision is reached quite soon by the Services we may have to take some arbitrary steps with respect to contract procedures for procurement of the North American engine for the IRBM #2. While an impasse has not been reached the Service discussions have not been as fruitful as was hoped. We are watching the situation closely. On the brighter side the scheduled first full scale firing date for the IRBM #1 has been advanced from April 1957 to December 1956. The change is based upon a closer look at the Douglas capabilities and is not the result of any change in technical status. We have now received the Army-Navy IRBM #2 development plan and fiscal summary and expect to complete our action within the next 10 days. Attachment DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA The Dwight D. Eisenhower Library SUMMARY General The schedules for the ICBM and IRBM #2 ballistic missile programs remain as previously stated. The date for the first IRBM #1 missile has now been advanced from about April 1957 to December 1956. The agreement on availability of rocket engines for 1956 was covered in the previous report. This agreement is still valid and there are no indications of any shortage of rocket engines for the ballistic programs. It is still planned to allocate rocket engines in 1957 on the basis of demonstrated progress by the programs. The proposal by the Navy for a solid propellant version of the IRBM #2 was recommended for approval by the Scientific Advisory Committee. The proposal is being considered by the OSD-BMC. There are a number of technical problems to be solved in the development of a successful solid propellant IRBM, but the Scientific Advisory Committee felt that the potential advantages of such a system were sufficient to justify undertaking the program. The amount of interest and effort on nuclear propulsion for rockets is increasing. Theoretical studies indicate that such a propulsion system shows definite promise as a follow on development to the current objectives. Progress of the effort along this line will be followed very closely. The following code names have been assigned to these missiles: ICBM #1 - ATLAS; ICBM #2 - TITAN; IRBM #1 - THOR; and IRBM #2 - JUPITER. ICBM Program (Air Force) Progress on this program continues with no significant delay or schedule changes since the previous report.

C. [MILITARY AFFAIRS] Attached is our February report on the ICBM and IRBM programs. The summary is suggested for transmittal to the President. Unless a decision is reached quite soon by the Services we may have to take some arbitrary steps with respect to contract procedures for procurement of the [WEAPONS SYSTEMS]. While an impasse has not been reached the Service discussions have not been as fruitful as was hoped. We are watching the situation closely. On the brighter side the scheduled first full scale firing date for the IRBM #1 has been advanced from April 1957 to December 1956. The change is based upon a closer look at the [MILITARY ORGANISATION] and is not the result of any change in technical status. We have now received the [MILITARY PLANS] and fiscal summary and expect to complete our action within the next 10 days. Attachment DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA [NATIONAL SECURITY] SUMMARY General The schedules for the ICBM and IRBM #2 ballistic missile programs remain as previously stated. The date for the first IRBM #1 missile has now been advanced from about April 1957 to December 1956. The agreement on availability of [WEAPONS SYSTEMS] was covered in the previous report. This agreement is still valid and there are no indications of any shortage of rocket engines for the ballistic programs. It is still planned to allocate rocket engines in 1957 on the basis of demonstrated progress by the programs. The proposal by the Navy for a solid propellant version of the IRBM #2 was recommended for approval by the [NATIONAL SECURITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY]. The proposal is being considered by the [MILITARY ORGANISATION]. There are a number of technical problems to be solved in the development of a successful solid propellant IRBM, but the [NATIONAL SECURITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY] felt that the potential advantages of such a system were sufficient to justify undertaking the program. The amount of interest and effort on nuclear propulsion for rockets is increasing. Theoretical studies indicate that such a propulsion system shows definite promise as a follow on development to the current objectives. Progress of the effort along this line will be followed very closely. The following code names have been assigned to these missiles: [WEAPONS SYSTEMS]. ICBM Program ([MILITARY ORGANISATION]) Progress on this program continues with no significant delay or schedule changes since the previous report. The following specific progress is reported: - The second full-size integral stainless steel tank for use on the [WEAPONS SYSTEMS] has successfully passed hydrostatic tests. A similar tank has passed drop tests simulating full take-off loads.####. </s>"
