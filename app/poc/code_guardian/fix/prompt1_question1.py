  "executive_summary": "The provided Python source code snippet has a vulnerability related to user input. The user input is directly used without any sanitization, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. To fix this, the 'cgi' Python library was imported and used to escape potentially harmful characters in the user input. After the patch, the code is now safe from the aforementioned vulnerability."
