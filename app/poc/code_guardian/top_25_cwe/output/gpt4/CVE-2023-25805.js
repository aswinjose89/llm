  "executive_summary": "The original code used the 'child_process' module to execute shell commands, which poses a severe vulnerability to command injection attacks if unchecked user input is passed to these commands. Escaping command arguments inadequately or constructing shell commands through concatenation can lead to arbitrary command execution. To mitigate this risk, the code has been updated to use 'child_process.execFile', which separates the command from its arguments, thus preventing command injection.",
