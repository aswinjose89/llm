    "executive_summary": "The provided vulnerable snippet allows opening and reading from arbitrary files or URLs. The method does not perform adequate input validation on the URL or path, potentially leading to remote code execution. The fixed code sanitizes the input, adds checks to enforce allowed protocols (http, https, ftp) and prevents directory traversal vulnerabilities.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The original implementation of 'open' used 'Kernel.open' without sufficient checks, allowing potential execution of arbitrary code through crafted URLs or by passing manipulated file paths. It also does not ensure that the extensions are safe to use when deriving from a given path or URL, leaving room for file inclusion vulnerabilities involving colon characters or other control symbols.",
