  "executive_summary": "The source code snippet showed a critical vulnerability where an input URL is not correctly sanitized which could be exploited by an attacker to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks or manipulate the URL parsing. The vulnerability has been fixed by properly handling exceptions that can be raised by URI.parse and replacing uri.read with OpenURI.open_uri to add an additional layer of security by utilizing the stdlib's open method that provides better handling of encodings and security features.", 
  "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability arises from using URI.parse directly on user-controlled input without adequate exception handling, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions or SSRF attacks if the URL is manipulated. Moreover, using uri.read to fetch external content can expose the system to various risks such as reading from an undesired file or network location.",
