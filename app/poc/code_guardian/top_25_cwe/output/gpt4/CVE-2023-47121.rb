  "executive_summary": "The vulnerable code was identified to potentially allow SSRF attacks due to improper URL parsing and unrestricted redirects, which could aid attackers in accessing internal services or leaking sensitive data. The fix comprises input validation, url normalization, restriction on redirects, and using secure read operations with proper exception handling.",
