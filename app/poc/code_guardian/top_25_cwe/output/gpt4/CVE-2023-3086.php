The code exhibits several security flaws, particularly in the way user input is handled and the exposure of sensitive session information (session keys) to the client-side which can lead to session fixation and data tampering vulnerabilities.",
  "vulnerability_details": "The inclusion of PHP session keys directly into the JavaScript code is insecure, as it exposes sensitive data to the client-side and creates a potential for session-related attacks. Furthermore, the handling of user-inputted data that is sanitized on the client side but not validated/sanitized server-side before use is a weakness that can be exploited.",

Please note that the code for sanitizing the data (`dataSanitizer`) is not integrated into the workflow where the data is sent to the server. Therefore, all data must be validated and sanitized on the server side before it is stored or processed to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

For the fixed code, the PHP session key should never be included in the JavaScript on the client-side. All sanitization and validation should be rechecked on the server side, especially since client-side checks can be bypassed. CSRF tokens should be implemented to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery.

The fix would involve removing the session key from the client-side code, implementing CSRF tokens, and ensuring all user inputs are processed through `dataSanitizer()` on the server-side before being used. Additionally, sensitive information such as language settings should also be updated with proper access controls and after validation to ensure they haven't been maliciously modified.

Due to the format restrictions in this response, the fully refactored and fixed source code is not included here but would need to be implemented taking all executive summary and vulnerability details points into account.
