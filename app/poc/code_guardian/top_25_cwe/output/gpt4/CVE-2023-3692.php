With careful validation of user inputs and the destination directory, as well as a secure handling of file extensions and movements, these vulnerabilities can be mitigated.",

Additionally, the misuse of user input in the URL without proper encoding may lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
