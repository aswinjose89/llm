    "executive_summary": "The vulnerable code snippet is susceptible to arbitrary code execution due to the use of an insecure loader in the YAML load function. The 'yaml.load' function without specifying 'Loader=SafeLoader' allows the processing of arbitrary objects that can lead to code execution. This vulnerability is fixed by importing 'SafeLoader' instead of 'Loader', and using 'CSafeLoader' as the Loader if it is available as it is faster than 'SafeLoader'.",
