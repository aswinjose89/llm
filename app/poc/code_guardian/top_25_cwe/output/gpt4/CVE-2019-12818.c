  "executive_summary": "The original source code was prone to buffer overflows due to lack of bounds checking before copying data into buffers and Kernel panic due to dereferencing NULL pointers. The code was missing validation on the sizes of the resulting TLVs when building NFC LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol) messages.",
  "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerabilities can cause buffer overflows which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service due to mishandling of TLV (Type, Length, Value) structures. Improper allocation and deallocation of memory can lead to kernel crashes and memory corruption. These vulnerabilities affected the functions responsible for sending NFC LLCP packets and building General Bytes (GB) buffers.",
