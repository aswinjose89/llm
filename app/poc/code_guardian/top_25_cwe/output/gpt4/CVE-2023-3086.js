  "executive_summary": "The vulnerability in the given code snippet originates from improper input sanitization before passing it through the DOMPurify.sanitize function. By manipulating the input strings, an attacker could potentially bypass the sanitization process, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The fixed code ensures proper HTML entity escaping before sanitization and provides a more robust defense against XSS.",
