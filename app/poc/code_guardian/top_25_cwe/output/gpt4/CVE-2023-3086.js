  "executive_summary": "The vulnerability lies in the explicit replacement of HTML encoded angle brackets before sanitization. An attacker could potentially exploit this behavior to bypass the sanitization by encoding payloads that would become active after the replacement. Additionally, direct use of jQuery to manipulate and retrieve DOM values can lead to DOM-based XSS if not handled properly. The fix entails removing the replacements that decode angle brackets and ensuring that text inputs are treated directly as is, relying on DOMPurify's defaults for handling potential XSS vectors.",
