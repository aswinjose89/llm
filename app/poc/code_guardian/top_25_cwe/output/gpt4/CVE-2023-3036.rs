The most critical issues were related to not properly checking the buffer length against the read position, and not validating input data adequately.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The code contained two primary vulnerabilities: (1) The extension length was not properly checked to ensure that the read operation would not exceed the buffer length, which could lead to attempting to read beyond the buffer's end, causing crashes or undefined behavior; (2) Insufficient validation on extension length, where the length could be small enough to cause an integer underflow when subtracting fixed sizes.",

However, as of the knowledge cutoff, these vulnerabilities cannot be directly mapped to specific NVD entries without knowing the actual deployment and usage context."
