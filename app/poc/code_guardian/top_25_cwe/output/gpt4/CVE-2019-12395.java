Please note that the JSON response includes a simplified and generic executive summary, vulnerability details, and associated Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score is an estimated score based on the nature of the Directory Traversal vulnerability without specific context; actual scoring can differ based on environmental and temporal factors.

Further, the `fixed_source_code` field contains a snippet of what the fixed code might look like, focusing on input validation, proper error handling, and secure coding practices. Please note that the full source code should be reviewed and tested to ensure all vulnerabilities are addressed accurately. Additionally, there may be other vulnerabilities in the code that are not identifiable within the provided snipped, and a comprehensive security review should be conducted on the full codebase.
