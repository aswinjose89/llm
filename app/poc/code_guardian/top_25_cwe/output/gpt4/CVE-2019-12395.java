  "executive_summary": "The code analysis revealed potential security vulnerabilities pertaining to improper input validation, which could be exploited to perform directory traversal attacks and lead to unauthorized access to files and data. Addressing these vulnerabilities with secure coding practices and input validation is essential to mitigate the risks involved.",

      "severity": "HIGH",
      "impact": "Attackers can gain access to sensitive files outside of the intended directories, leading to information disclosure.",
      "recommendation": "Implement strict path normalization and validation to prevent directory traversal. Also, properly handle edge cases such as null or malformed inputs.",
