  "executive_summary": "The source code review identified SQL injection vulnerabilities within the update methods of a PHP class due to the concatenation of unescaped input into SQL queries. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the provided code has been updated to use prepared statements with parameter binding instead of direct concatenation. This change not only prevents SQL injection attacks but also promotes better coding practices for database interactions in PHP applications.",
