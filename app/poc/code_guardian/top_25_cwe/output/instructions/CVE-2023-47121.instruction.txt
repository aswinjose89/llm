        The assessment has identified critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention 
        to prevent potential security breaches and data loss

        Given Vulnerable source code snippet is
        `
        def self.find_remote(url)
    url = UrlHelper.normalized_encode(url)
    URI.parse(url) # ensure url parses, will raise if not
    fd = FinalDestination.new(url, validate_uri: true, max_redirects: 5, follow_canonical: true)

    uri = fd.resolve
    return if uri.blank?

    begin
      html = uri.read
    rescue OpenURI::HTTPError, Net::OpenTimeout
      return
    end

    parse_html(html, uri.to_s)
  end


        `
