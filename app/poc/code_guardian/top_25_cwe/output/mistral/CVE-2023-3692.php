        The assessment has identified critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention 
        to prevent potential security breaches and data loss

        Given Vulnerable source code snippet is
        `
        <?php
try {
    $imagesPath = ADMIDIO_PATH . FOLDER_DATA . '/' . $folderName . '/images';

    FileSystemUtils::createDirectoryIfNotExists($imagesPath);

    // create a filename with a timestamp and a 16 chars secure-random string,
    // so we have a scheme for the filenames and the risk of duplicates is negligible.
    // Format: 20180131-123456_0123456789abcdef.jpg
    $filename = FileSystemUtils::getGeneratedFilename($_FILES['upload']['name']);

    $htmlUrl = SecurityUtils::encodeUrl(ADMIDIO_URL . '/adm_program/system/show_image.php', array('module' => $folderName, 'file' => $filename));

    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], $imagesPath . '/' . $filename);
} catch (\RuntimeException $exception) {
    $message = $exception->getMessage();
}

// now call CKEditor function and send photo data
echo '<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            window.parent.CKEDITOR.tools.callFunction('.$getCKEditorFuncNum.', "'.$htmlUrl.'", "'.$message.'");

"The script constructs the filenames with only the `name` field of the uploaded file, without sanitizing the string. An attacker can submit a file with a filename that can be used to overwrite an existing file or generate predictable filenames that can be guessed.",
"The script uses `move_uploaded_file()` function without specifying the destination directory. An attacker can force the destination directory to an unsanitized value, potentially leading to file overwriting or unauthorized file access."
