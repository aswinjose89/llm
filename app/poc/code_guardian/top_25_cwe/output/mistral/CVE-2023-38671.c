        The assessment has identified critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention 
        to prevent potential security breaches and data loss

This could potentially lead to security breaches and data loss.<br><br><b>2. Unexpected dimension matching:</b> The dimensions of the attributes used to infer metadata are not allowed to be identical. However, the dimensions of the input tensor and the metadata attribute are equal. This could potentially lead to security breaches and data loss.<br><br><b>3. Overlapping dimensions:</b> One dimension check is for the maximum value of the range, while another check is for the minimum value of the range.
