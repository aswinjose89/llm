        The assessment has identified critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention 
        to prevent potential security breaches and data loss

        Given Vulnerable source code snippet is
        `
        from yaml import load
from yaml import YAMLError

try:
    from yaml import CLoader as Loader
except ImportError:
    from yaml import Loader

def LoadSettingsFile(filename=SETTINGS_FILE):
    """Loads settings file in yaml format given file name.

    :param filename: path for settings file. 'settings.yaml' by default.
    :type filename: str.
    :raises: SettingsError
    """
    try:
        with open(filename) as stream:
            data = load(stream, Loader=Loader)
    except (YAMLError, OSError) as e:
        raise SettingsError(e)
    return data
