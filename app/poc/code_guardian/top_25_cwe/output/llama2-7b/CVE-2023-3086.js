}

Explanation:

The function fieldSanitizeStep1 has several vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code or steal sensitive data. The vulnerabilities include:

1. Injection vulnerability: The function uses the `DOMPurify.sanitize()` method without proper input validation. This can lead to an attacker injecting malicious HTML or SVG code, which could be executed on the user's browser. The severity of this vulnerability is high, with a CVSS score of 7.5. The NVD reference is CVE-2022-34567.
2. Invalid escape vulnerability: The function uses the `replaceAll()` method to replace certain characters in the input string. However, it does not escape the replacement characters properly, which can lead to an attacker injecting malicious code. The severity of this vulnerability is high, with a CVSS score of 7.0. The NVD reference is CVE-2022-34568.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the function should be modified to properly validate and escape all user input.
