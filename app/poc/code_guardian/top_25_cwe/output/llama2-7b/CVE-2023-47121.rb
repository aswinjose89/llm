  Sure, here's the assessment report for the given source code snippet in JSON form:

{
"programming_language": "Ruby",
"compiler_name": "MRI",
"fixed_source_code": "None",
"executive_summary": "The `find_remote` method in the given Ruby code is vulnerable to a URL encoding vulnerability.",
"vulnerability_details": "The `find_remote` method takes a URL as input and uses `UrlHelper.normalized_encode` to encode the URL. However, this method does not properly validate the input URL, which can lead to URL encoding vulnerabilities.",
"vulnerability_type": "Input Validation",
