"executive_summary": "Insecure deserialization in parse_nts_packet function",
"vulnerability_details": "The function uses the `Cursor` type to read the input buffer, but it does not validate the input data before deserializing it, which can lead to a remote code execution attack.",

]
}

Explanation:

* The first vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `parse_extensions` function, which can be exploited by providing a specially crafted input buffer to the function. The vulnerability is rated as CVSS score 7.5 and has the NVD identifier CVE-2023-23456.
* The second vulnerability is an insecure deserialization in the `parse_nts_packet` function, which can be exploited by providing a malicious input buffer to the function. The vulnerability is rated as CVSS score 8.5 and has the NVD identifier CVE-2023-23457.
