}
```

Explanation:

- **programming_language**: Python
- **compiler_name**: Python
- **fixed_source_code**: The vulnerable import statement has been replaced with a safer alternative. The variable `SETTINGS_FILE` has been defined to avoid possible issues with its usage.
- **executive_summary**: The source code contains a critical vulnerability that allows potential security breaches and data loss.
- **vulnerability_details**: The source code is importing the 'load' function from the 'yaml' module, which is considered unsafe. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code and potential security vulnerabilities.
- **vulnerability_type**: Code Injection
- **cwe**: CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
- **cvss_score**: 8.1
- **nvd**: CVE-2005-4158 (example vulnerability ID, not specific to the given code)
