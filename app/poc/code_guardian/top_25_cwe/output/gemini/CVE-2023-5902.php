  "executive_summary": "The root cause of the vulnerability in the provided code snippet is the lack of authorization checks before allowing access to sensitive user information and submission data. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious user IDs and group IDs, allowing them to bypass authorization restrictions and access unauthorized data.",
  "vulnerability_details": "In the original code, the `userInGroup` method checks if a user with a given ID is a member of a group with a given ID. However, it does not check if the context ID of the submission matches the context ID of the user group. As a result, an attacker could provide the ID of a user who is not a member of the intended user group but who is a member of a different user group with the same ID. This would allow the attacker to bypass the authorization check and gain access to submission data that they should not have access to.",
