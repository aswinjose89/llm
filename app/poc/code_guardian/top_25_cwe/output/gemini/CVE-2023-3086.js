This can allow an attacker to bypass the sanitization and inject malicious scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting specially crafted input that contains malicious scripts. These scripts could then be executed in the user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, hijack the user's session, or redirect the user to malicious websites.",
