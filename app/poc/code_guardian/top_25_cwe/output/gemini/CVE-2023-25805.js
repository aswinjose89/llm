This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server by providing specially crafted input.",
  "vulnerability_details": "The `child.exec()` function takes a command string as its first argument. If this string is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious commands into it. For example, an attacker could provide input that includes a semicolon followed by a system command, such as `'; rm -rf /*'`. This would cause the `child.exec()` function to execute the `rm -rf /*` command, which would delete all files on the server.",
