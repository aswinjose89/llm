  "executive_summary": "The provided vulnerable Java code is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via a resource exhaustion issue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to the affected server, causing the server to become unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.",
  "vulnerability_details": "The issue resides in the `handle` method, which lacks proper checks to handle concurrent tile read requests. When the server receives multiple concurrent requests for the same tile, it attempts to acquire a read lock on the corresponding tile using the `tile.getReadLock(5000)` method. However, the lock acquisition is not retried upon failure, potentially leading to a resource exhaustion scenario where legitimate requests are blocked, and the server becomes unresponsive.",
