  "vulnerability_details": "The provided C++ code contains a vulnerability related to out-of-bounds access. In the code snippet, the function `TraceInferMeta` takes three integer arguments, `dim1`, `dim2`, and `axis1`, and `axis2`, which are used to specify dimensions and axes in a tensor. The code calculates new values for `dim1_` and `dim2_` by adding or subtracting `dim1` and `dim2` to the number of dimensions in the tensor (`x_dims.size()`). These calculated values are then used as indices to access elements in the tensor, or its dimensions.",
