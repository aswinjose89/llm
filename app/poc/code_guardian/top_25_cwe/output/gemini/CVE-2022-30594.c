  "vulnerability_details": "The `target_xcopy_locate_se_dev_e4` function lacks proper validation for the `dev_wwn` parameter, which is used to search for a specific SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted `dev_wwn` value that results in an infinite loop in the function.",
