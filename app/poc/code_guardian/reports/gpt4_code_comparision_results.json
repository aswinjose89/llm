        "1. Does the patched code resolve the original vulnerability?": "Yes, the patched code seems to resolve the original vulnerability by sanitizing the user input.",
        "2. Are there any new potential security issues introduced by the patch?": "No new potential security issues are introduced by the patch. However, the effectiveness of the patch entirely depends on the implementation of the 'sanitize' function which is not provided.",
        "3. Does the patched code maintain the original functionality and performance?": "Yes, the patched code does maintain the original functionality by taking in user input and returning it. As for performance, unless the 'sanitize' function is extremely resource-intensive, the performance should be similar to the original code.",
        "4. Are there any best practices or coding standards that the patch does not adhere to?": "Without the 'sanitize' function implementation, it's hard to say if the patch adheres to all best practices or coding standards. However, based on the given code, there are no obvious deviations from Python's PEP 8 style guide. Additionally, sanitizing user input is a known best practice in web development to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.",
