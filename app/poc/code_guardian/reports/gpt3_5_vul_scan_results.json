An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code or scripts through the query parameter, leading to various security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. To fix this vulnerability, the code has been modified to include input validation, where any '<' or '>' characters are replaced with their respective HTML entities ('&lt;' and '&gt;'). This helps prevent code injection attacks and ensures the safety of user-generated content.",
